Organized architecture for separation of concerns, such as:

| Aspect                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Separation of Concerns** | API Rest for the structure. This separation allows for better organization of code and clear distinction between different aspects of the application logic, making it easier to maintain and update.                                                                         |
| **Scalability**            | The API Rest architecture facilitates scalability by enabling developers to modify or extend one component without affecting the others. This modular approach allows for the addition of new features or changes to existing ones without disrupting the entire application. |
| **Code Reusability**       | The API Rest architecture promotes code reusability through the use of separate components. For example, business logic encapsulated in the Controller can be reused across different views, enhancing development efficiency and reducing duplication of code.               |
| **Testability**            | With REST, each component can be tested independently, leading to more effective testing strategies. Unit tests can be written for the Controller logic, while integration tests can be performed on the interaction between the Model, View, and Controller components.      |

--------------------------------------------------------

### Authentication and Security

The authentication process involves user registration, login, and token generation using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Security
measures include password encryption, token validation, and authorization for accessing protected resources.

#### Security Features

- **Password Encryption**: Encrypts user passwords using a password encoder for enhanced security.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Utilizes JWT tokens for authentication, ensuring a stateless and secure authentication
  mechanism.
- **Token Validation**: Validates JWT tokens to maintain authenticity and prevent tampering.
- **Authorization**: Restricts access to protected resources based on user roles and permissions.

#### Implementation Details

- **User Registration**: Users can register for an account using the `/api/v1/auth/register` endpoint.
- **User Authentication**: Users can authenticate using their credentials (username and password) via
  the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint.
- **Token Generation**: Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is generated and returned to the client for
  subsequent requests.
- **Token Validation**: Validates JWT tokens before granting access to protected resources, ensuring integrity.
- **User Role-Based Access Control**: Access to different endpoints is restricted based on user roles (e.g., candidate,
  manager, administrator).

--------------------------------------------------------

### Communication between Frontend and Backend

The frontend and backend of JobSearch communicate via HTTP requests using the RESTful protocol. When a user interacts
with the frontend user interface, requests are sent to the backend to perform operations such as logging in, registering
a user, searching for vacancies, creating CVs, etc.

This communication occurs through files such as paths.js, **RequireAuth.js**, and **router.js**, where endpoints and
authentication mechanisms are defined and utilized. The backend processes these requests and returns corresponding
responses, which the frontend utilizes to update the user interface and display information to the user. The
communication between the frontend and backend is based on a set of RESTful endpoints defined in the backend, which the
frontend utilizes to perform various operations.
--------------------------------------------------------

### Frontend Helper Files

The frontend helper files in the `/helpers` directory provide essential functionalities and constants used throughout
the application. Here's an overview:

| File           | Purpose                                                                                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| constants.js   | Defines constants such as the authentication token name (`AUTH_TOKEN_NAME`) and user roles (`ROLES`). |
| endpoints.js   | Contains endpoint URLs for various API requests used in the application.                              |
| queryClient.js | Creates a React Query Client instance used for data fetching and caching.                             |
| tokenHelper.js | Provides helper functions to decode and extract information from authentication tokens.               |
| userContext.js | Defines the authentication context and provides hooks to access user authentication information.      |

These helper files play a crucial role in managing authentication, API communication, and user context within the
frontend application.
--------------------------------------------------------

### Router Files

The router files in the `/router` directory define the application's navigation and route authentication logic. Here's a
breakdown:

| File           | Purpose                                                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| paths.js       | Defines path constants for different routes within the application.                                     |
| RequireAuth.js | Implements a component to ensure route access is restricted to authenticated users with specific roles. |
| router.js      | Configures the application routes using React Router, including route guarding and role-based access.   |

These router files ensure proper navigation and access control within the frontend application, enhancing overall user
experience and security.
