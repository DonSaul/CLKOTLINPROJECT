üóÇÔ∏è **JobSearch** is a web platform for employment and management aimed at facilitating interaction between candidates
and managers. The project is a product of SoftServe's project lab, where we focus on learning and improving our skills.

## Features

### User Authentication and Authorization:

- Users can register an account with their Last Name, First Name, password, and email.
- Users can log in with their credentials.
- Different roles (candidate, manager, admin) with specific permissions are supported.
- Managers can create new user accounts with specific roles.

### Candidate Features:

- Candidates can create and manage their CV, including information about years of experience, projects, education, and
  salary expectation.
- Candidates can search for vacancies based on job family, years of experience, and salary expectation.
- Candidates can apply to vacancies that match their skills and expectations.

### Manager Features:

- Managers can create and manage vacancies, including job family, company name, description, required years of
  experience, and salary.
- Managers can search for candidates based on filters such as years of experience, job family, and salary expectation.
- Managers can send vacancy invitations to candidates who match the job requirements.

### Communication Features:

- Users can communicate with other users (managers or candidates) within the app.
- Users receive email notifications for important actions such as new vacancies, invitations, and messages.
- Users can respond to messages and notifications directly from the email.

### Integration and Testing:

- All features are seamlessly integrated to ensure they work together.
- Thorough testing is conducted to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
- The codebase is optimized and refined for better performance and reliability.

### Documentation and Finalization:

- The codebase is thoroughly documented, including APIs and usage instructions, for future reference.
- Any remaining tasks or bug fixes are finalized before deployment.
- The project is prepared for deployment and ensured to be production-ready.

Organized architecture for separation of concerns, such as:

| Aspect                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Separation of Concerns** | API Rest for the structure. This separation allows for better organization of code and clear distinction between different aspects of the application logic, making it easier to maintain and update.                                                                         |
| **Scalability**            | The API Rest architecture facilitates scalability by enabling developers to modify or extend one component without affecting the others. This modular approach allows for the addition of new features or changes to existing ones without disrupting the entire application. |
| **Code Reusability**       | The API Rest architecture promotes code reusability through the use of separate components. For example, business logic encapsulated in the Controller can be reused across different views, enhancing development efficiency and reducing duplication of code.               |
| **Testability**            | With REST, each component can be tested independently, leading to more effective testing strategies. Unit tests can be written for the Controller logic, while integration tests can be performed on the interaction between the Model, View, and Controller components.      |

#### Related Classes

- `Cv`: Entity representing user's curriculum.
- `JobFamily`: Entity representing a job family.
- `CvRepository`: Repository for accessing curriculum data.

The `CandidateDTO` represents the details of a candidate.

## Authentication and Security

The authentication process involves user registration, login, and token generation using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Security
measures include password encryption, token validation, and authorization for accessing protected resources.

#### Security Features

- **Password Encryption**: Encrypts user passwords using a password encoder for enhanced security.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Utilizes JWT tokens for authentication, ensuring a stateless and secure authentication
  mechanism.
- **Token Validation**: Validates JWT tokens to maintain authenticity and prevent tampering.
- **Authorization**: Restricts access to protected resources based on user roles and permissions.

#### Implementation Details

- **User Registration**: Users can register for an account using the `/api/v1/auth/register` endpoint.
- **User Authentication**: Users can authenticate using their credentials (username and password) via
  the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint.
- **Token Generation**: Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is generated and returned to the client for
  subsequent requests.
- **Token Validation**: Validates JWT tokens before granting access to protected resources, ensuring integrity.
- **User Role-Based Access Control**: Access to different endpoints is restricted based on user roles (e.g., candidate,
  manager, administrator).

### Communication between Frontend and Backend

The frontend and backend of JobSearch communicate via HTTP requests using the RESTful protocol. When a user interacts
with the frontend user interface, requests are sent to the backend to perform operations such as logging in, registering
a user, searching for vacancies, creating CVs, etc.

This communication occurs through files such as paths.js, **RequireAuth.js**, and **router.js**, where endpoints and
authentication mechanisms are defined and utilized. The backend processes these requests and returns corresponding
responses, which the frontend utilizes to update the user interface and display information to the user. The
communication between the frontend and backend is based on a set of RESTful endpoints defined in the backend, which the
frontend utilizes to perform various operations.

### Frontend Helper Files

The frontend helper files in the `/helpers` directory provide essential functionalities and constants used throughout
the application. Here's an overview:

| File           | Purpose                                                                                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| constants.js   | Defines constants such as the authentication token name (`AUTH_TOKEN_NAME`) and user roles (`ROLES`). |
| endpoints.js   | Contains endpoint URLs for various API requests used in the application.                              |
| queryClient.js | Creates a React Query Client instance used for data fetching and caching.                             |
| tokenHelper.js | Provides helper functions to decode and extract information from authentication tokens.               |
| userContext.js | Defines the authentication context and provides hooks to access user authentication information.      |

These helper files play a crucial role in managing authentication, API communication, and user context within the
frontend application.

### Router Files

The router files in the `/router` directory define the application's navigation and route authentication logic. Here's a
breakdown:

| File           | Purpose                                                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| paths.js       | Defines path constants for different routes within the application.                                     |
| RequireAuth.js | Implements a component to ensure route access is restricted to authenticated users with specific roles. |
| router.js      | Configures the application routes using React Router, including route guarding and role-based access.   |

These router files ensure proper navigation and access control within the frontend application, enhancing overall user
experience and security.
